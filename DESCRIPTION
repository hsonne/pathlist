Description: This package implements a S4 class pathlist that internally
    stores a vector of file paths (as, e.g. received with dir()) as a
    matrix of path segments.  I found out that this is the most compact
    form to store the paths.  The main feature of the class is the dollar
    function that allows to filter paths for the value of their top-level
    folder.  Using the dollar operator subsequently you can easily narrow
    down the list of paths.  The class implements functions length(),
    head(), tail(), summary(), and show().
