Description: This package implements a S4 class pathlist that internally stores
    a vector of file paths (as, e.g. received with dir()) as a matrix of 
    path segments.  I found out that this is the most compact form to store the
    paths.  The main feature of the class is the dollar function that allows
    to filter paths for the value of their top-level folder.  Using the dollar
    operator subsequently you can easily narrow down the list of paths.  The
    class implements functions length(), head(), tail(), summary(), and show().
